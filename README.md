# Python_Scraping
 
In my internship, my boss asked the group and me to manully collect movie info and review data online.

It occurs in my mind that why don't I finish the process automaticlly by python scraping?

So I conducted movie competitive analysis to study market trend and improved media relation database; I utilized Python to web scrape review, rating, and release information on 100+ crime movies, reducing working time by 50% than planned. And I finished all the work for one month in one day.
